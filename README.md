# Neutral-Metabolic-model
This repository contains scripts and functions used to simulate the dynamics of neutral and metabolic processes.

# ExtractOcc function
Function used to extract species occurrence data

# GridApproxFunct function 
Grid-approximation function used to run the neutral-metabolic model, saving the results with each parameter combination

# NeutralTempModel function
Function used to simulate the dynamics of communities through neutral (Neutral Theory of Biodiversity) and metabolic (Metabolic Theory of Ecology) processes.

# HypotheticalExample
Script used to simulate the dynamics of neutral and metabolic processes with hypothetical data.
